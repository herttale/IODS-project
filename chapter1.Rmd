# Week 1
## About the project

This is my first week learning R and R markdown on IODS course. For the next weeks I'll be publishing my completed exercises here. 

Here's a link to my published GitHub page/course diary: [https://herttale.github.io/IODS-project/](https://herttale.github.io/IODS-project/) 

And here's to my GitHub repository: [https://github.com/herttale/IODS-project](https://github.com/herttale/IODS-project)

Enjoy!
